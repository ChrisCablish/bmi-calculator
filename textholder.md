To use Sass in your project and implement the provided design more efficiently, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Step 1: Install Sass

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
Open your command line or terminal.
Run the following command to install Sass globally: npm install -g sass
Step 2: Create a Sass file

Create a new file in your project directory and name it style.scss.
Copy the content of your existing style.css file into this new style.scss file.
Delete the original style.css file (we'll generate a new CSS file from Sass).
Step 3: Import Bootstrap in your Sass file

Open the style.scss file.
At the top of the file, import Bootstrap by adding the following line:
@import 'path/to/bootstrap'; (Replace 'path/to/bootstrap' with the actual path to your Bootstrap CSS file)
Step 4: Compile Sass to CSS

In your command line or terminal, navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to compile your Sass file to CSS:
sass style.scss style.css
Step 5: Link the compiled CSS file in your HTML

Replace the existing link to style.css in your HTML file with the following:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
Step 6: Verify everything is working

Open your HTML file in a web browser and ensure that the styles are applied correctly.
At this point, your project should be set up to use Sass alongside Bootstrap. You can now make use of Sass features like variables, mixins, and nesting to write cleaner and more maintainable CSS code. Remember to recompile the Sass file to CSS every time you make changes to your style.scss file.
